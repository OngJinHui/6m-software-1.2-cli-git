                <p>My <a href = "https://github.com/OngJinHui">GitHub</a> profile is a work in progress.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The things that I like to do to relax my mind:</p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Looking at the outside view from the office pantry</li>
                    <li>Drinking a warm cup of coffee</li>
                    <li>People watch</li>
                    <li>Walking in the light rain</li>
                    <li>Feeling the breeze of the sea on my face</li>
                </ul>
